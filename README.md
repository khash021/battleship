# Battleship

Java project simulating the popular battleship game.

This is a work in progress and will be updated periodically.

At the current state, it is only a one-way game; the computer generates one ship (it can vary in size from 1-point, to 3), and then the user has limited number of tries (based on their input), to guess the location of the ship.
